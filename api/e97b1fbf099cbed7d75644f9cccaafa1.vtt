WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:04.220
(All of us) us, us

00:04.260 --> 00:09.600
(Dream save us us) us, all of us

00:14.360 --> 00:16.940
The end of a dream, the end of the sea

00:16.980 --> 00:19.650
We all have different places we want to go

00:19.690 --> 00:22.160
But first, we need

00:22.200 --> 00:26.530
To make a shining legend out of ourselves

00:27.990 --> 00:30.370
Sparks fly, no limit, this is where it starts

00:30.410 --> 00:32.000
ONE PIECE!!

00:32.040 --> 00:34.630
All of us, I ask you travelers

00:34.670 --> 00:37.920
Are your dreams still pure?

00:40.050 --> 00:46.390
Sleepless cells are shaken and burst

00:46.430 --> 00:53.140
Still, all of us, in the middle of an adventure

00:53.190 --> 00:55.650
All of us, I tell you travelers

00:55.680 --> 00:59.440
No such thing as a pointless fight

01:01.240 --> 01:03.570
When random contexts

01:03.610 --> 01:07.530
Start to make sense on their own

01:07.580 --> 01:13.950
The threads of time are spun back together

01:14.290 --> 01:19.500
The world keeps changing along with us

01:19.550 --> 01:22.050
(All of us) us, us

01:22.090 --> 01:27.420
(Dream save us us) us, all of us

01:53.860 --> 01:55.360
Sabo-san!

02:10.830 --> 02:12.200
Everyone!

02:12.250 --> 02:13.550
I'm back!

02:14.670 --> 02:16.510
I heard about Kuma-san.

02:16.630 --> 02:17.800
I'm sorry.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.430
All your efforts have gone to waste.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.890
Sabo. Even the captains can't hear
what you have to say?

02:27.390 --> 02:32.310
Yeah... It might endanger their lives
to know it.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.190
What's it about?

02:35.610 --> 02:37.950
This Reverie was tumultuous...

02:39.410 --> 02:42.870
I'll tell you all about
what really happened...

02:42.910 --> 02:44.490
at the Holy Land Mary Geoise!

02:48.620 --> 02:53.380
"Sabo Returns -
The Shocking Truth to Be Told!"

02:54.090 --> 02:56.800
KAMABAKKA QUEENDOM

03:01.260 --> 03:03.600
We accomplished all our missions.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.560
We had three general objectives.

03:10.350 --> 03:14.070
Declaring war by destroying
the symbol of the Celestial Dragons.

03:14.650 --> 03:18.900
Freeing as many slaves as possible
and rescuing Kuma-san.

03:19.490 --> 03:22.740
And destroying the food reserves
in the Land of Gods.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.200
How did it turn out?

03:25.330 --> 03:26.290
Well...

03:27.040 --> 03:29.990
We've caught enough of
the world's attention.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.790
Thanks to you for keeping
most of the Naval forces busy,

03:34.840 --> 03:40.880
the citizens of 12 countries revolted,
encouraged by us,

03:41.300 --> 03:45.390
and eight of them were successful.

03:46.430 --> 03:49.350
They called it the Eight-Nation Revolution,

03:49.850 --> 03:52.980
but one of the countries,
the Kingdom of Lulusia...

03:54.060 --> 03:55.900
...mysteriously vanished.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.860
You witnessed it, right?

04:04.660 --> 04:06.080
Anyway,

04:06.120 --> 04:09.870
you made the world a lot better!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.160
It hasn't been reported in the newspapers,

04:12.620 --> 04:15.330
but seven nations
that brought about revolutions...

04:15.380 --> 04:21.670
...are declining both to pay the Heavenly Offerings
and to export natural resources to the Government.

04:22.120 --> 04:26.890
The Revolutionary Army is attacking
the Government's supply carriers around the world...

04:26.930 --> 04:30.020
...to keep resources
from reaching Mary Geoise!

04:30.140 --> 04:30.640
HOLY LAND MARY GEOISE

04:30.640 --> 04:32.640
Because it's located so high up, people say
Mary Geoise is an unbreakable fortress,
HOLY LAND MARY GEOISE

04:32.640 --> 04:35.480
Because it's located so high up, people say
Mary Geoise is an unbreakable fortress,

04:36.730 --> 04:39.570
But I bet they can't stand
our starvation tactics!

04:39.610 --> 04:43.610
They must learn what it is like
to live without money and food!

04:43.950 --> 04:46.320
Heehaw!

04:47.700 --> 04:49.290
We can expect some effect, right?

04:49.910 --> 04:52.000
Yes, it's highly likely.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.570
Not all supplies are being cut off,

04:55.620 --> 05:00.460
but I'm sure it's steadily
starting to torment them.

05:01.550 --> 05:06.090
And of course, they're not
the kind of people who will just endure it.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.310
When they dispatch the Holy Knights,

05:09.720 --> 05:11.770
the real battle will start!

05:12.520 --> 05:14.020
The Holy Knights...

05:14.480 --> 05:15.310
Sabo!

05:15.730 --> 05:18.110
I mean, Flame Emperor boy!

05:18.560 --> 05:21.860
You're their number one target now!

05:22.230 --> 05:24.860
That nickname doesn't sit well with me.

05:24.990 --> 05:28.320
But that nickname instantly
made you a household name.

05:28.450 --> 05:30.530
Even if it's not true,

05:31.080 --> 05:36.040
the assassination of King Cobra
made you a hero.

05:40.290 --> 05:43.300
From the perspective of the insurgents
all over the world,

05:43.760 --> 05:47.840
everyone involved with the World Government
is the same.

05:47.890 --> 05:51.930
Of course, there are some kings
who should be blamed for misrule,

05:51.970 --> 05:55.640
but there are also many righteous
and competent kings in the world.

05:57.230 --> 05:59.610
Among such kings,

05:59.650 --> 06:04.860
King Cobra of Alabasta was known
as an excellent and benevolent monarch,

06:05.650 --> 06:08.780
but sometimes,
the truth is not told correctly.

06:12.620 --> 06:13.450
But I'm...

06:14.080 --> 06:15.620
...fine with that.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.000
I feel bad for King Cobra...

06:18.830 --> 06:22.380
But if it'll kindle the flames of revolution!

06:23.500 --> 06:25.090
You're unshakable.

06:26.050 --> 06:29.130
Now, explain to us!

06:29.840 --> 06:31.010
KING COBRA ASSASSINATED
The truth...

06:31.010 --> 06:31.050
KING COBRA ASSASSINATED

06:31.050 --> 06:32.680
...behind this shocking news!
KING COBRA ASSASSINATED

06:32.680 --> 06:34.560
...behind this shocking news!

06:35.140 --> 06:38.850
We were all trying to speculate
the reason with tears in our eyes.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.690
Because we wanted to believe you!

06:48.320 --> 06:49.450
What I...

06:50.660 --> 06:52.490
...witnessed on that day...

06:54.410 --> 06:56.700
More than a month ago,

06:57.620 --> 07:03.380
during the Reverie, the world council
held in the Holy Land Mary Geoise.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.470
It's an emergency! Someone trespassed
into the Land of the Gods!

07:10.880 --> 07:12.970
Please evacuate immediately!

07:13.100 --> 07:15.970
The food storage exploded-eh!

07:16.100 --> 07:19.940
Do something, bureaucrats!
There are intruders-eh!

07:20.060 --> 07:24.230
Four Revolutionary Army captains
have been identified on the premises!

07:24.270 --> 07:26.150
Catch them now!

07:26.280 --> 07:29.320
What are you doing?! Keep walking-eh!

07:32.320 --> 07:34.240
Damn!

07:34.280 --> 07:37.370
Not only the symbol of the World Nobles,

07:37.410 --> 07:39.960
but they even targeted
our luxurious food reserves!

07:40.070 --> 07:42.670
The poor are jealous of us-eh!

07:42.710 --> 07:44.920
Make sure you catch and behead them!

07:47.210 --> 07:49.760
Everyone!
It's dangerous so please evacuate!

07:51.010 --> 07:54.180
We should execute all the guards
after that-amasu!

07:54.220 --> 07:58.560
You can't let this happen to us
and get away with it-amasu!

08:03.100 --> 08:07.190
I told you to hurry up! You sluggish dog!

08:11.030 --> 08:15.370
What if something happens to me!
Go faster-eh!

08:24.380 --> 08:25.540
Ouch!

08:26.880 --> 08:29.380
You useless bastard!

08:29.420 --> 08:32.220
Forget it! I'll walk myself-eh!

08:34.260 --> 08:36.180
You're fired-eh.

08:40.710 --> 08:42.090
You piece of trash!

08:59.080 --> 09:00.120
My gun!

09:01.450 --> 09:03.540
Who are you-eh?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.080
How could you...

09:06.500 --> 09:08.670
...take other people's lives so lightly?!

09:09.250 --> 09:10.880
Karasoot!

09:16.260 --> 09:18.140
Run to the east side of town.

09:18.260 --> 09:18.930
What?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.890
O-Okay!

09:22.100 --> 09:24.730
St. Pluming! Please evacuate quickly!

09:25.020 --> 09:27.940
Cipher Pol! What took you so long-eh?!

09:27.980 --> 09:30.940
Get rid of that vermin now-eh!

09:31.070 --> 09:33.940
The Revolutionary Army?! Take him down!

09:39.950 --> 09:41.990
We got him!

09:42.370 --> 09:43.830
Let's fill him with bullets!

09:43.950 --> 09:46.790
Wipe him out completely-eh!

09:49.130 --> 09:50.000
What?!

09:50.130 --> 09:53.670
H-He really got wiped out!

09:53.800 --> 09:55.510
Just who is he?

09:55.880 --> 09:57.130
Did we kill him?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.230
Obelisoots!

10:24.450 --> 10:25.540
You piece of trash.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.870
KARASU (SOOT-SOOT FRUIT POWER USER)
CAPTAIN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
NORTHERN FORCES

10:41.680 --> 10:44.470
I feel two tremendous surges of Haki!

10:46.230 --> 10:48.690
I can't believe they attacked Mary Geoise...

10:49.850 --> 10:52.690
They're such reckless bastards!

11:30.420 --> 11:31.960
Help me already-eh!

11:32.090 --> 11:33.250
No!

11:36.340 --> 11:38.970
Sir! Ma'am! I'm begging you!

11:39.430 --> 11:41.720
Please let us escape, too!

11:41.760 --> 11:44.100
Help!

11:44.220 --> 11:45.980
There you are!

11:48.850 --> 11:51.270
I'm here to help you all!

11:55.570 --> 11:58.240
None of you move!

11:59.320 --> 12:02.370
Laser Shooter!

12:13.250 --> 12:16.510
Hurry up! Wait at the east side of town!

12:16.550 --> 12:18.550
We'll get out of here together!

12:20.220 --> 12:21.050
Th...

12:21.180 --> 12:24.680
--Thank you!
--Thank you!

12:25.220 --> 12:26.810
You can thank me later!

12:27.230 --> 12:28.980
Make sure you get there!

12:32.770 --> 12:35.190
Look at that!

12:36.190 --> 12:38.610
LINDBERGH, CAPTAIN OF
THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY SOUTHERN FORCES

12:39.150 --> 12:41.570
Lindbergh!
The enemies are coming this way!

12:43.120 --> 12:45.240
Hurry up freeing the slaves!

12:45.370 --> 12:46.450
Got it!

12:56.800 --> 12:58.840
Something is coming...

12:59.300 --> 13:00.760
Something strong!

13:00.880 --> 13:02.090
JUSTICE

13:05.680 --> 13:06.760
Crow...

13:09.810 --> 13:11.140
...Soul Lotus!

13:40.630 --> 13:42.050
Come back!

13:42.090 --> 13:45.430
You slaves should not defy me-eh!

13:47.680 --> 13:49.770
What's this-eh? The ground!

13:57.980 --> 13:59.190
What's going on-eh?!

13:59.320 --> 14:02.150
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.780
A Giant?!

14:07.700 --> 14:09.580
That's not nice!

14:09.870 --> 14:13.120
You have to stop shooting people like that!

14:13.500 --> 14:16.460
You guys, get out of here now!

14:16.500 --> 14:20.510
Go to the east side of town!
My friends are expecting you!

14:21.550 --> 14:23.970
MORLEY, CAPTAIN OF
THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY WESTERN FORCES

14:24.430 --> 14:26.430
Be careful!

14:26.550 --> 14:28.050
Thank you!

14:32.310 --> 14:36.020
You damn punks of the Revolutionary Army!

14:48.700 --> 14:51.950
You do understand exactly
what it means...

14:52.000 --> 14:55.620
...to go against the Celestial Dragons,
don't you?!

14:59.790 --> 15:00.550
Gee!

15:06.590 --> 15:09.010
What's wrong with this boy?!

15:09.050 --> 15:11.140
He gets mad so easily!

15:11.260 --> 15:12.890
Because you guys...

15:13.470 --> 15:15.520
...are destroying the town!

15:15.560 --> 15:17.650
Where did your leader go?!

15:18.100 --> 15:20.980
Why are you asking me questions?!
You're so naughty!

15:21.020 --> 15:22.360
You pervert!

15:23.570 --> 15:27.320
Look who's talking!
What are you wearing?!

15:29.410 --> 15:31.740
Hey, my eyes are up here!

15:33.620 --> 15:37.210
Whoa. Why are you staring at me?

15:37.870 --> 15:39.580
Do you...

15:39.630 --> 15:40.840
...like me?!

15:41.250 --> 15:42.090
What?!

15:46.340 --> 15:48.220
Shut up!

15:51.850 --> 15:53.890
Hey! Ryokugyu!

15:55.220 --> 15:56.310
Ryokugyu!

15:56.730 --> 16:00.270
If any of us gets hurt,
you'll be sentenced to death-eh!

16:00.400 --> 16:03.980
It's hard to fight! Just go away already!

16:10.030 --> 16:10.660
What?

16:11.280 --> 16:14.370
Hey, Fujitora! What are you doing?!

16:15.160 --> 16:16.660
I'll bring down...

16:16.700 --> 16:18.040
...a meteor.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.290
You can't do that! Stop it, you fool!

16:21.880 --> 16:23.880
Two admirals...

16:23.920 --> 16:27.800
If this were not the Land of the Gods,
they could easily obliterate the landscape.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.930
Yet they're fighting so roughly.

16:30.260 --> 16:33.180
I guess there's no room for us to step in.

16:34.810 --> 16:37.020
Do they wanna destroy Mary Geoise?!

16:37.520 --> 16:41.310
Even though they have the disadvantage,
the Revolutionary Army is sticking with it.

16:41.900 --> 16:46.070
Their captains must be quite strong...

16:46.530 --> 16:47.530
So intense!

16:49.570 --> 16:50.610
Well...

16:51.160 --> 16:54.700
We should get going.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.380
Sabo!

17:08.970 --> 17:10.630
Have you found the keys to the collars?!

17:11.010 --> 17:12.340
It won't take much longer!

17:13.090 --> 17:14.680
I found out where they are.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.590
Lindbergh!

17:20.730 --> 17:21.940
What is it?

17:22.480 --> 17:24.400
Kuma-san came to Pangaea Castle!

17:24.520 --> 17:25.150
What?!

17:27.030 --> 17:29.850
I saw Saint Rosward and his son Charlos...

17:30.700 --> 17:33.350
SABO, CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY

17:33.780 --> 17:37.540
I think they're on their way to finish
what they attempted at the Mingling Courtyard.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.200
What?!

17:40.110 --> 17:40.910
What are you...?!

17:42.710 --> 17:43.920
Please stop!

17:46.250 --> 17:50.800
I found one-eh! I found a giant Mermaid-eh!

17:57.560 --> 18:01.020
I'll make her my pet this time for sure.

18:01.430 --> 18:04.350
With this one's strength...

18:04.850 --> 18:07.770
I guess they can't give up on
Princess Shirahoshi...

18:08.320 --> 18:10.860
How dare they use Kuma-san for that!

18:11.320 --> 18:14.070
Of course, I won't let them do that!

18:14.450 --> 18:16.620
Morley, get ready!

18:16.740 --> 18:17.740
Okay!

18:18.370 --> 18:21.700
I will save... Kuma-san at any cost!

18:28.710 --> 18:29.840
Dad!

18:40.010 --> 18:41.970
Where are you going all by yourself?

18:42.020 --> 18:43.060
Princess Vivi.

18:43.180 --> 18:46.400
You're... from CP-0.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.030
Please go back to your room.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.490
Can you leave me alone?!

18:54.070 --> 18:56.570
I'm going to go to
Vice Admiral Garp for help!

18:57.240 --> 18:59.580
We will protect you all.

18:59.700 --> 19:03.370
You guys didn't protect Shirahoshi earlier,

19:03.410 --> 19:04.870
did you?!

19:05.410 --> 19:06.210
I bet you know!

19:09.790 --> 19:13.130
They'll come after her again!

19:18.510 --> 19:19.890
Your Majesty.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.390
You'd better not to push yourself...

19:24.850 --> 19:26.940
No, I'm okay.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.230
Chaka, Pell.

19:29.900 --> 19:33.360
I finally get to meet the Five Elders.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.320
I may never have
an opportunity like this again.

19:40.370 --> 19:42.790
Let's go.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.130
Stop!

19:56.510 --> 19:59.760
Only King Cobra is permitted
an audience with the Five Elders.

19:59.890 --> 20:00.800
But...

20:00.930 --> 20:04.020
...Cobra-sama is not in good health.

20:04.140 --> 20:05.730
Stand back.

20:07.980 --> 20:08.940
Cobra-sama...

20:12.730 --> 20:14.940
This won't take long,

20:14.980 --> 20:17.450
but I think it'll be boring to
just wait outside.

20:17.820 --> 20:20.200
I need you to guard Vivi.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.530
She's still so mischievous,

20:22.950 --> 20:25.240
and I can't stop worrying about her.

20:32.460 --> 20:37.590
How far I have run

20:38.300 --> 20:44.890
Without knowing it, I counted scars

20:45.350 --> 20:52.310
A treasure map in my head all along

20:52.360 --> 20:58.820
Still looking for the future

20:58.860 --> 21:05.530
The real promise

21:05.580 --> 21:12.710
Lies much deeper in my heart

21:12.750 --> 21:21.840
A dream that no one can catch up with

21:21.880 --> 21:27.560
That's all I hold on to

21:27.600 --> 21:34.650
To you who smiles like the sun

21:34.690 --> 21:41.570
I'll sing the same song as that day

21:41.610 --> 21:48.620
This wish I don't want to forget even when I grow up

21:48.660 --> 21:56.090
Until it reaches you

22:02.930 --> 22:07.010
"Dive into the Sea of Information!
The Punk Records Library!"

22:07.810 --> 22:14.190
Hi, I'm Lilith, one of the Satellites of
Dr. Vegapunk, the genius scientist!

22:14.310 --> 22:17.480
I'm Edison, also Vegapunk!

22:17.520 --> 22:20.030
Today we'll introduce this one! Morley!

22:20.650 --> 22:23.950
He is a Giant and the captain of
the Revolutionary Army Western Forces.

22:23.990 --> 22:27.240
He uses the Push-Push Fruit power
which enables him to push anything away!

22:27.370 --> 22:29.790
His bounty is 290 million berries.

22:29.830 --> 22:34.330
He was born on September 11
and likes bagna cauda!

22:34.460 --> 22:39.460
He was once an ill-famed pirate
and imprisoned at Impel Down.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.880
But he successfully escaped the prison
with his Push-Push Fruit power.

22:44.010 --> 22:47.760
The tunnels he carved to escape
later became New Kama Land.

22:47.890 --> 22:50.930
He's serving as a captain
in the Revolutionary Army,

22:50.970 --> 22:56.440
and defeated Blackbeard's subordinate Peachbeard
who was attacking the Kingdom of Lulusia.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.810
Shoot him to death!

22:57.940 --> 22:59.110
What?!

23:00.360 --> 23:02.900
Stop it, boys!

23:06.070 --> 23:07.620
At the Holy Land Mary Geoise,

23:07.660 --> 23:11.910
he declared war on the Celestial Dragons
along with Sabo and the other captains,

23:11.950 --> 23:15.410
and they successfully rescued
Bartholomew Kuma.

23:15.540 --> 23:18.460
I should be careful
because he can push me away, too.

23:18.500 --> 23:23.170
Anyway, I really wanna know
what happened at the Holy Land Mary Geoise!

23:23.300 --> 23:24.970
That's it for today!

23:25.010 --> 23:28.510
Now that you've seen it,
donate to our research fund!

23:28.640 --> 23:30.890
See you next time!

23:35.980 --> 23:39.980
The Celestial Dragons take advantage
of their authority and do whatever they like.

23:40.020 --> 23:43.980
While even the royal families
turn a blind eye to their unruly behavior,

23:44.030 --> 23:46.150
two pirates stand up to them!

23:46.200 --> 23:50.870
They, who pledged to serve Luffy,
bring down the hammer of wrath!

23:51.490 --> 23:52.790
On the next episode of One Piece!

23:52.830 --> 23:56.910
"The Holy Land in Tumult!
Sai and Leo's Full-Power Blow!"

23:56.960 --> 24:02.130
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!
